# Release Notes (v0.1.0 -> v0.2.48)

## v0.2.48 (2026-03-16)

- [Added]
- Added built-in `unRAID` app support with default metadata, dedicated icon asset, and multi-instance placeholder text for server-style deployments.
- Added an `unraid` widget integration that polls the Unraid GraphQL API with an API key and exposes CPU, memory, array, and alert metrics for widget bars.
- [Fixed]
- Fixed `Settings -> Apps` so unRAID shows the same API-key access form as the per-app settings page instead of omitting the credential field on that surface.
- Improved unRAID widget compatibility by probing multiple GraphQL memory-field shapes before marking the widget offline.

## v0.2.47 (2026-03-12)

- [Added]
- Added Plex settings token-resolution helpers plus automated tests for primary and secondary Plex instance selection.
- [Changed]
- Updated Plex-specific settings, dashboard, and deep-launch handling to recognize Plex multi-instance app IDs via base-app detection.
- Updated `Get Plex Token` and `Get Plex Machine` settings actions to target the selected Plex app instance instead of always using the primary `plex` app.
- [Fixed]
- Fixed secondary Plex instances resolving the wrong server token from the primary Plex session context.
- Fixed Plex-specific dashboard/settings behavior that only activated for the literal `plex` app ID, which caused gaps for instance IDs such as `plex-2`.

## v0.2.46 (2026-03-11)

- [Added]
- Added built-in `Curatorr` app support with dedicated icon assets plus default launch subpages for Dashboard, History, Artists, Discover, Tracks, Playlists, and admin Settings.

- Updated launch-page chrome to show the active submenu label in the window title and keep submenu navigation highlighted.
- Updated embedded Curatorr launches to pass Launcharr theme and square-corner preferences into the iframe and resync them after appearance changes.

- Fixed embedded Curatorr theme drift after Launcharr day/night or square-corner preference changes.

## v0.2.45 (2026-03-05)

- [Added]

- [Changed]
- Updated overview carousel swipe handling so pointer capture is only used for mouse drags.

- [Added]
- Added multi-dashboard support with dashboard tabs/definitions, per-dashboard name/icon/visibility, and admin add/duplicate/delete controls in `Settings -> Custom -> Dashboard`.
